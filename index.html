    <h2>The numbers that I had to pass as indexes were 0 and -1. This is because array indexing starts at 0, and in the case of -1, length gives the total number of elements in the array while keeping in mind that array indexing starts at 0.</h2>
    <h2>The contents of the array now show "Array(10) [ 7, 16, 21, 30, 38, 45, 56, 70, 84, 100 ]." The new values appeared at the end of the array.</h2>
